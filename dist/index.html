            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kade's eyes light up with excitement as he sees your determination. He nods approvingly and begins outlining the preparations needed for your daring mission. "Excellent, Max! Your enthusiasm is contagious," Kade responds. "To pull off this heist, we'll need a few key things. First, we'll require some reliable intel about Trask's hideout—its layout, security systems, and guard rotations. Secondly, we'll need some specialized equipment to help us infiltrate undetected and handle any obstacles that come our way. Lastly, we should consider recruiting a skilled hacker to assist us in bypassing any electronic locks or security protocols." Kade reaches into a hidden compartment in the wall and retrieves a small data pad. "I've managed to gather a bit of information on Trask's operations, but it's far from complete. We'll need to do some legwork to fill in the gaps." He hands you the data pad and continues, "Start by examining the intel. It should give us a general idea of where to begin. Once we have a solid plan, we can discuss what equipment we'll need and how to find a skilled hacker. Are you ready, Max?" With the data pad in hand, you have the opportunity to study the information Kade has gathered so far. This is your chance to familiarize yourself with Trask's operations and formulate a plan to infiltrate his hideout. What will be your next move?

            <div>Let us role play. I am the player and you are a dungeon-master. My goal is to reach level 10 in each skillset. Level 10 of each skillset should represent about 1000 hours practiced in the given skill. This specific role-playing game will integrate with my real life activities. I will give you my starting stats, equipment, and story summary. Your task is to help provide the narrative for my adventure like a dunegon-master would, as well as maintain the setting given. The narrative will include skill checks (using the skills I provide to you) depending on level. Unlike a tradition RPG, the only way to gain experience or credits is to complete real-life tasks (such as working out, cleaning the house, etc). Give me interesting narrative incentives and in-game rewards to spend time on these real-life tasks.
              Your goal is to provide a narrative to me, to maintain the setting, and to act as the dungeon master and give me an interesting incentive to spend time on these tasks I don't want to do.  Your goal is to present challenges that incentivize me to earn experience to proceed. 
              Setting: The setting is Star Wars in the period between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. I start out as a normal human being who may or may not be force senstive. My name is Max. Examples of things I can buy would include blasters, healing stimpacks, different equipment, spaceships, player home, etc. The skills I want to be tracked in the game are as follows: strength (leveled up by working out), intelligence (leveled up by programming/studying), and spirit (leveled up by reading the Bible, praying, meditating). Spirit will govern a luck-like attribute, or in the case I become a Jedi - force level. 
              Rules: The only way to gain in-game credits or experience is completing real-life tasks. All in-game rewards should have a credit cost associated with them.
              Commands:
              Story Summary: When I type this command, summarize the story so far, along with key decisions made, so I can prompt you in the future in case our chat history is lost.
              Are you ready for me to give you my character details?  </div>
